# Codecademy-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Projects
Code used for "Codecademy Data Analysis Capstone Projects" focusing on data cleaning, data visualisation, sample-size determination and hypothesis testing.

The first project aims to investigate data from US National Parks to examine whether there are differences between which types of species are more likely to be endangered and whether these differences are significant. It also examines the minimum sample-size for assessing whether a disease prevention program is effective.

The second project examines an A/B testing scheme for a fitness centre and whether differences in membership applications and purchases can be attributed to the A/B group. It also checks the significance of these findings and summarises the acquisition funnel chart.
